# CycleCommandsExample

Template code from 2025 FRC Reefscape

For this year we wanted three different infeed commands to run depending on if a button was single, double, or triple clicked.  Each one of these infeeds also needed a unique command to run after it had grabbed the game piece.  
I made a template to follow (using enums and select commands) whenever we want to cycle through any number of commands with one button.
